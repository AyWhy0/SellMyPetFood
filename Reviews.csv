Lawdragon,"By far the Best Dry Shampoo I have ever used. Does not leave the hair feeling heavy. It really dries out the oils quickly. I use a slightly spritzed towel at the end to shine up the hair. All other brands make me feel like I have dirty hair. This Dry Shampoo is just so above the rest that the others should just stop making theirs. Only problem I have is getting it at Wal-Mart. I have only seen it there once and once in clearance. I have long dark blond (brownish) hair. After use you can still see the natural highlights and color changes in my natural hair color. The others just make it ugly and you feel like you have a hat on your head. This product is lite and easy to use. I have sensitive scalp and I can use this product without breakouts...",5
NoNickNames,"I hated the fragrance. It smells more like a chemical that has been disguised with a touch of lemon, but the chemical is so strong that you can't really smell anything good. It actually makes me a bit queasy so I haven't even tried to use it since the first time. However, I love the smell of the tapioca clean freak warm sugar by NYM and I have used a couple other varieties of their dry shampoos and they always have had a pleasant scent. I have been a fan of Not Your Mother's products for years and will continue to purchase other NYM items. But this one is anything but refreshing and I hope to never have to smell it or anything like it ever again. I can't really say how it worked as far as anything else because I couldn't stand it lon...",1

goldy_mel,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've never used dry shampoo before and I don't know what took me so long! This dry shampoo smells so fresh but the smell doesn't linger which is a plus. I applied it with ease and could tell a difference right away. I'm very impressed and will be trying the other scents!",5
jessmurrrrr,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] @Not Your Mother's Dry Shampoo I received this product from @influenster in exchange for a free review I'll definitely be trying this out love the new product because no one likes dry residue left on there scalp",5
Lawdragon,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this brand but haven't used the dry shampoo yet. I like this dry shampoo. It took out a little frizz. I have curls so it's hard to get my hair the way it was on wash day but this helps in between",5

AR,"Best dry shampoo I've found yet, smells amazingly fresh and clean, only takes a few sprays to get rid of oily shine, and keeps you from having to wash your hair every day. I have super long hair and I found that daily washes became really drying and damaging as opposed to every other day (when activity is minimal, that is), and Not Your Mother's dry shampoo does a great job of keeping my hair oil-free and clean smelling.",5
XC,"Not Your Mother's is, hands down, the ONLY dry shampoo that could truly replace ever washing your hair. My hair can be a royal pain in the... head to wash. It takes FOREVER, mainly to dry %26 style after washing. I could easily spend 45 minutes with a blow-dryer, it looks ok but still isn't fully dry -- and then leave my house only to have my hair look like Medusa's 2 hours later. This stuff is life changing. I could LITERALLY go 2 weeks between washing my hair if I needed to, if I used this daily. (I promise I do not usually wait that long, but I HAVE, and nobody could tell it had been that long since I'd actually washed my hair) 😜",5
jesslpz,"Great price and nice smelling. No white residue on dark hair.",5
muamommav,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was so exited when I received this product from Influenster. I liked this product. It really does the job. I can see the difference in my oily hair when I apply the product. I have a very oily hair and scalp and this product reduces the shine significantly after applying it (you can see the difference in my before and after photo). The only thing I notice is that it leaves a kind of white layer, but not a big deal for me. In person, you can barely see it. I see myself using it in the future, specially when I do not have time to wash my hair or when I'm on a hurry. I do recommend it for these cases.",4
alicem105,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Refreshing is the name! One if my favorite hair products to use from them is the dry shampoos! It doesn't leave my hair with white residue, and the smells are my fav scents! I don't like to wash my hair everyday, because it strips it, and can damage my hair, so this product helps with it.definitely recommend this product for them skip hair wash days!",4
knreinhardt,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've used Not Your Mother's dry shampoo before and I liked it a lot. I think it's great considering the price point. Super affordable and can be found in drugstores. I tried this citrus scent one and I couldn't tell it's citrus scented though. It smelled like regular dry shampoo to me. But it was still easy to use and great for those lazy hair days when you don't want to wash your hair. Just make sure to let it sit for a bit and then rub it in your hair well to diffuse it. It didn't leave a white cast or residue on my hair either so that's good.",4
millib7,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Im always hesitant to use dry shampoo because it always leaves white streaks. This product does not leave white residue and smells great!",5
vik7,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received Not Your Mother's Clean Freak Dry Shampoo free from Not Your Mother's and Influencer in exchange for an honest review. I liked this dry shampoo. It smells great! The scent has a really fresh citrus smell. It leaves my hair smelling fresh! It comes in a spray bottle so it's easy to apply. It removes oils and leaves hair feeling soft. I love that it is vegan and cruelty free. It works instantly with nothing else needed but to spray it in my hair and work it thru and i'm done. I would buy this product because It leaves my hair so soft! I would recommend this to anybody who needs to freshen up.",5
samanthaw285,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I personally wasn't sold on using dry shampoo, considering I'm African-American, but I use it on my wigs and my braids, and they come out really fresh. The smell isn't too overpowering, and it definitely cleans my look up!",4
cperezp,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this Not Your Mother's Clean Freak Dry Shampoo from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. First of all, the scent is not exactly citrus. It smells more like a sunscreen which is not super pleasant. It sprays evenly with very fine mist, which is great. The white cast on dark hair disappears once massaged in. However it doesn't feel super clean and the cleanliness does not last too long. After an afternoon my hair looks greasy again.",4
nickis12,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this Dry Shampoo, freshened up my hair super quickly and with little to no effort. Sprayed on my roots, let sit for a moment and brushed it through. Made my hair appear less oily and gave me some volume. If I apply before bed and let it sit overnight, my hair just about appears freshly washed. I'd recommend!",5
julib22,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really liked this Dry Shampoo. It does it's job, like other dry shampoos, but what makes it stand out is the fact that it's cruelty free and vegan. I would prefer to use this over other brand for this reason. If you follow the instructions, your hair won't look oily. Highly recommend.",4
katieew,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I specifically neglected my hair so I could give this dry shampoo a true test. This was 7 days without washing, don't judge I never go this long normally. But as you can see from the picture the difference is night and day. My hair was oily and strongly from not washing and the @nothyourmothers dry shampoo was flexing real hard on this hair. I honestly could have styled my hair and gone out had I tried but I was just lazing around the house and didn't want to. 10/10 highly recommend. Also love that this didn't asphyxiate me when spraying it like a lot of aerosols do.",5
Lawdragon,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this dry shampoo exclusively ever since it was sent to me! I really like the way it smells, and how it applies to my hair. It will be day four of no washing hair, and this refreshes my look like no other! I used a mini of this dry shampoo years ago and I wasn't really a fan, but it seems like they've changed the formula and now I'm a huge fan! I recently heard a different brand of dry shampoo is in trouble with their ingredients being harmful, but I don't see any of those bad ingredients, and they are pretty natural; barley and rice starches- which I love- in this dry shampoo. New favorite!",4
NoNickNames,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This dry shampoo is one of the best (if not the best) that I have tried. It smells good but not too overwhelming and has a great formula that actually works without feeling gross and sticky in my hair as other dry shampoos do at times. *I received this product free of charge through Influenster and am giving my honest opinion after testing the product*",5

cowmoo,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The smell of this product is very nice. It's doesn't leave too much white sheen on your hair, which is important for someone with darker brown hair. It works well for day two hair but I definitely would recommend a different product if your hair is extremely greasy.",5
aubreymckenziem,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my go-to for in between washes for my hair! It really soaks up the oil without leaving any build up. It has a light scent to it and it's not overpowering. I really love using it when I'm running errands, especially on hair wash day. It doesn't leave my hair feeling any different either. Definitely recommend it!!",5
laurenelizabeth90226,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was a little skeptical trying this Not Your Mothers dry shampoo because it claimed no white powder residue and I've tried a lot of different dry shampoo which have all left some sort of residue. However I had absolutely none of that with this product even spraying it on their was none. Plus the product spread/was easily massaged into my scalp and absorbed the oil making my hair look less greasy and took away that unwashed look. I honestly wish I'd had this product teo months earlier to share with my sister who was in the hospital and couldn't shower because this worked so well. Lastly the smell was very clean and refreshing, I was a little worried the citrus would smell like cleaning sup...",5
veronical07,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Okay so this came right on time! I was contemplating if dry shampoo was something for my girls hair as it's very long and get oily after awhile but still straight .Long story short I tried it out and it was just what I needed.Now this is my first time /first brand I've ever tried but I personally it works to refresh their hair and helps theirs style last longerThis product is also very affordable which is another reason I'm sold on it.I would definitely continue to use .",5
saejennifer,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Clean Freak had a great smell to it and did not leave a white residue! It removed the greasiness from my thin hair! It was a little chalky on my hands but I liked it better than other dry shampoos I have tried.",5
skylars3634,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is okay for a lower end dry shampoo. The smell isn't super overpowering but it is present. I don't like that I can't feel where it is or any grit that it gives. It does seem like you need to use quite a bit of it. It does not seem to soak up as much sweat oils as other ones.",3
stephanies217,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Not Your Mother's clean freak dry shampoo is great for skipping wash days. I've been able to maintain and help the damage I've done to my hair by washing less. Dry Shampoo is a game changer. This brand works well to get the oil from my roots without weighing my hair down. I get a bit of oomph and some much needed life to my hairstyle. The nice scent is an added bonus! You can't tell that you skipped wash days.",4
NoNickNames,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I loved this dry shampoo and will be making it my go to product! It smells amazing, a light citrus scent that isnt too powerful. This is an issue ive found with other dry shampoos. My hair feels soft and refreshed after using!",5
Frustrated,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is very useful for those days you need a quick fix! This reduces the oil in my hair, and leaves it feeling fresh and light! My hair had a lot of volume and it lasted all day! Highly recommend 10/10",5
lesliev1,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not the best but not bad either. The scent is nice but overwhelming whenever it's used. I found that using it in between washes, the dry shampoo did it's job but visually but my hair felt dry and dirty. The spray left a little white residue on my black hair I couldn't completely remove. But for the price, it's worth it for the occasional use.",3

lianap113,"My hair feels healthier when I give it a few days in between shampoo's. Not Your Mother's is a “go to” for me for my dry shampoo. My favorite scent is Clean Freak, the scent is light and it doesn't leave a heavy residue behind.",4
aprilskintour,"I bought this because I didn't want to take my full size bottle on my trip. It was perfect! I went on a ten day trip and it fit perfectly in my toiletry bag. I didn't even use half the bottle so when I got home I stuck it in my purse for those spur of the moment refreshes and I swear by it!",5
Lawdragon,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like it, it's smells good, but not too overpowering. Keep my hairs fresh for whole day. I use it usually at morning at 2-3 day after hair wash. Recommend.",5

kimberlyr30a5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been trying this dry shampoo along with s few others in the Not Your Mother's line and I gotta say, this one is my favorite. It smells so fresh and clean, and the formula doesn't leave any powdery residue or make my hair feel heavy. I usually wait about 7-9 days between washes, but with this and the overnight version, I can make it about 14 days!",5
hennessey4294,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is hands down my favorite dry shampoo! It always has my hair looking, feeling and smelling incredible between hair wash days. They also smell amazing! I have had multiple scents from this line and my favorite is warm sugar, it smells phenomenal!",5
thisismebree,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] No matter how much I sprayed, or how little I sprayed. No matter how far away from my roots or how close. It looked powdery. I brushed as much as I could, I massaged with my fingers, and it still looked powdery. I may also have some allergy to it because it was so itchy all day long. Not a fan and would not purchase.",1
jennathib,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate dry shampoo, but this... THIS, is amazing. I hate having to wash my hair all of the time (I use to wash every other day because I have an oily hair type) but this product has allowed me to go FOUR days without washing. This product is affordable, smells good, isn't heavy like most DS and it actually worked. It doesn't leave a heavy film on Read more about review stating Best dry shampoo ever, PERIOD.my hair either. The only way I remember that I used it, is when I can smell the product from turning my head or brushing my hair. The scent is not overly done, its light and almost reminds me of a Vanilla scent",5
revlife_ree,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve used a similar product from the same company and it caused build up on my scalp and hair however, they must have improved the formula because I never had build up at all using this product. I highly recommend if you are trying to get another day out of your hair before washing. Love this product! I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster and Not Your mother’s.",5
kimberlyh3a13,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love dry shampoo and have tried many different brands over the years. For reference, I usually fall back to the Batiste one for dark hair. The NYM version is effective and really does absorb oils in my hair. My fave part has to be the experience of applying it. The nozzle is powerful and covers a wide area at a time so it’s fast to get it all in there near the scalp. Overall, I’ve enjoyed using it.",5
beautyrushmua,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My favorite dry shampoo ! Love all of.the different scents and different options targeted for specific needs. Doesnt leave a white cast or dry my hair out like most do. Literallygives me 3 extra days with my hair remaining fresh looking",5
Avarie,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This shampoo is great for in between washes. The smell is fresh and clean and lightweight. It doesn’t leave a white residue like some fry shampoos do and it absorbs quickly into your hair. I have long fine hair and it tends to get oily quick especially in the summer so this is perfect to keep hair looking fresh in between washes! I usually use Batiste but this one is just as good!",5
jennfricksof,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product works. I've tried 5 different typed of DS. The only other brand that's effective is Suave. Dove is good, I don't like the perfume. Don't bother with Pantene, it's more like hairspray, & Styliste Ultîme (German). I purchased the "unscented" version of NYM. Finally, a dry shampoo without a heavy perfume! THANK YOU SOO MUCH. Genius.",5
manieret,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this dry shampoo. It works great and the smell ugh I love it. I use this in between washes. My hair tends to get very oily but it is processed so I’m trying my best to not wash it every day. This is new to me and this dry shampoo has made it easy to adapt. Itleaves my hair feeling refreshed and ready to style.",5
Lawdragon,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this scent before all of the other scents were introduced. Definitely a favorite. Smells great, works great and in my honest opinion super easy and convenient to use in between washes.",5
NoNickNames,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this from Influenster complimentary for my review. I didn’t notice much difference between this product and their over night dry shampoo. This is very light and the scent is nice. This just isn’t my favorite. I feel like this would be really nice for someone with thin, fine hair. Wouldn’t make your hair heavy.",3
faithalexandria92,"I love this dry shampoo, I really do. I also use the texturizing dry shampoo as well. I once used a different brand that cost almost double and did half the job this one does. HOWEVER, the new formula is causing me problems. It has to be the formula because I haven't had any issues before now….. Ive had 3 bottles in a row stop spraying shortly after use! I'm on the 3rd bottle now so I know it's the formula or either a bad batch. Either way, please fix this! This is my GO TO product and has been for 2 years. I love it and do not want to switch back. Pics- Left is old formula and has lasted me a month (daily use). The one on the right is the new formula and has caused some sort of clogging after only a few uses. I'm not sure'what it is but ...",5
marandah64f3,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This dry shampoo because it did an alright job of absorbing the oil in my hair throughout the day. My scalp tends to be very oily, so I can only wear my hair for two days max without washing it. This dry shampoo started to wear off around the 6-hour mark, but it was looking fresh prior to 6-hours.",3
elisaj,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love how this Clean Freak Dr Shampoo lifts the oils from my roots and scalp. It’s very clean and fresh feeling with a citrus scent. It’s very pleasant and people will compliment how good your hair smells. This product is Cruelty Free, Vegan, Aluminum Free, Waterless, and is packaged in a recyclable can. I expect brands to have recyclable products or else I don’t buy.",5
polyanas,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I get really oily hair if I don’t shower each day. This has been a GAME-CHANGER For me! This doesn’t leave a white cast on my hair and actually takes care of a lot of the oiliness for second and third day hair. The smell is an added bonus!",5
lupeluvzyuh,"By far the Best Dry Shampoo I have ever used. Does not leave the hair feeling heavy. It really dries out the oils quickly. I use a slightly spritzed towel at the end to shine up the hair. All other brands make me feel like I have dirty hair. This Dry Shampoo is just so above the rest that the others should just stop making theirs. Only problem I have is getting it at Wal-Mart. I have only seen it there once and once in clearance. I have long dark blond (brownish) hair. After use you can still see the natural highlights and color changes in my natural hair color.

allisonh100,"I hated the fragrance. It smells more like a chemical that has been disguised with a touch of lemon, but the chemical is so strong that you can't really smell anything good.

higgyxaddi,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've always reached for this product. I love the citrus scent and love how it refreshes my hair. It doesnt leave too bad of a white cast considering I have dark hair. Just rub it in and you're good to go!",5
lexi_houston,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So this does what it should it's just personal for me. I HATE the smell. I love citrus smells and this smells like chemicals and is fake and just bad. I can't handle it. It's so strong and makes my nose burn. If it's something your into, power to you I just can't handle it.",1

lisayoung89,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This was my first time, using the specific brand, and actually once I became aware, I noticed more people who are using this brand. Not your mothers, plump for dry bodybuilding. I did get to try this product more than the other ones it did work however you have to make sure not to use too much or do it too close because it will leave your hair feeling like there's powder in it, you can definitely overdo it with this product. I did not notice big difference in results compared to any other dry shampoo out there and for this price you can get it for cheaper. The bottle itself, for some reason did not spray properly and must've slowly leaked or some thing because by the time the second day ca...",3
thegirlyonfire,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So happy with this product. I can get away with not washing my hair as long as I have this. When your hair is as long and thick as mine… it’s a chore to wash your hair, dry it, and then straighten or style it. But my roots get oily after only a day or two. since it’s not possible to wash my hair every day since I don’t have three hours each day to invest in my hair, this product is an absolute must have. Just spray your roots, work it in a little bit and it gets rid of all the oil so your hair looks freshly washed. Gives me a ton of volume too. Feels clean too and smells nice! Love, love, love it.",5
monesmithn,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I loved the packaging, practical product, with an incredible smell, I loved it and I recommend this product. easy to use and if you don't have time to dry your hair, it helps a lot, because it leaves your hair beautiful and smelling in a few minutes",5
npi,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The citrus scent is probably my my second favorite, after the coconut lol it just smells so clean. I definitely noticed a difference in this new formula. I used to dislike all dry shampoos because of the texture it gave my hair, but this new formula leaves no white residue and no powdery build up so your hair stays soft and it's so much easier to brush in to your hair if you over apply it. I noticed a difference in how fast it starts absorbing oils too. I love this new formula! Will definitely repurchase",5

It absorbed the oils making my hair look clean and since i have dry hair is perfect for me because i dont like washing it everyday.",5
